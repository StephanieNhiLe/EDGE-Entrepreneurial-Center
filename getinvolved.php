                    <h3>Mercer County Endowment Fund</h3>
                    <p>
                    Established in 2019, the Mercer County Endowment Fund was built to be a local source of
                    funds to support initiatives or projects in Mercer County that a) align with local and/or regional
                    priorities and b) were identified by a process which included feedback from members of the
                    community. All gifts to MCEF are permanently held in trust as endowed assets of the Quad
                    Cities Community Foundation, whose fiscal oversight and responsibility ensures the fund is
                    properly invested and stewarded for the permanent benefit of Mercer County. Endowment funds
                    are designed to last forever, meaning your contribution will support our community many times
                    over.
                    <br> To donate to the Mercer County Endowment Fund or to learn more, contact MCBT Executive
                    Director Kyle McEwen at kyle@mcbettertogether.org or (309) 574-3123.

                    <h3>Mercer County Emergency Housing Fund</h3>
                    <p>
                    Established in 2022, the Mercer County Emergency Housing Fund provides those in need with
                    a safe, warm place to stay when they need it most. This fund is an initiative of the Mercer
                    County Housing Task Force and is administered by Mercer County Better Together. Many
                    homeless individuals in our rural area reside in garages, storage units, cars, tents or as ‘couch
                    surfers’ in others’ homes. Very few options currently exist for people seeking shelter in Mercer
                    County. Your contribution will provide short-term lodging and associated essentials for those in
                    our community who lack stable housing.

                    <h3>Annual Challenge</h3>
                    <p>
                    MCBT has made an economic impact in Mercer County of over $18 million, with an overall
                    return-on-investment (or ROI) of 18:1. For every dollar into the organization, MCBT has
                    produced about $18 in value for the Mercer County community through projects, programs and
                    initiatives. Contributions like yours make it possible for MCBT to exist.
                    <br>A generous contributor has offered to match every local dollar raised by MCBT during the year,
                    up to $25,000. Local dollars raised are tracked by MCBT throughout the year, with an annual
                    fundraising deadline of November 30th. Your contribution to MCBT's Annual Challenge will be
                    doubled and will unlock outside dollars to support the Mercer County community.
